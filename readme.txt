Generate solutions to common math problems.

== Description ==

Quatriceps is a free mathematics API for generating solutions to basic arithmetic problems. This plugin allows easy setup of Quatricep blocks on a Wordpress blog for student use.

When a student submits a problem, a formatted solution is retrieved from a remote server. Quatriceps operations and output will emphasize instructional solutions. Tetragy welcomes requests for new operations that may be specific to a user or organization.

See the Tetragy Quatriceps API page for all currently supported operations. A demo is available at https://wp.tetragy.com/quatriceps.

== Installation ==

1. Download and extract the Simple-MathJax and Quatriceps zip file to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Enable the Simple-MathJax and Quatriceps plugins
3. Use Shortcode in your posts to include a Quatriceps operation. For example: `[quatriceps com="addition"]`.
